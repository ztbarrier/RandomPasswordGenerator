# RandomPasswordGenerator

This program is used to generate random strings of 7 characters that uses both upper & lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols.

The program uses multiple ArrayLists, to further improve my understanding of the Data Structure. It also is fully commented, to show why I did 
everything I did, and to show the understanding of collections. 

I plan on revisiting the project to make it MUCH more useful, as in letting passwords save to a local file with the account name the user wants it too.
